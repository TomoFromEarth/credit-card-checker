# credit-card-checker

- This is a program that will check if a given array of numbers, or a nested array of numbers, are valid credit card numbers.

- It will also create a new array and store any invalid card numbers that it finds.

- Then it will create an array of the card companies that have issued invalid cards so that they can be notified.

- It should be noted, this is NOT a viable program as it does not pass the PayPal card account tests, as this only checks to see if the number arrays provided pass the luhn check which was the scope of this projects goals.

- If anyone out there would like to help me learn how to turn this into an actual cc validator by explaining to me how it would check for actual valid cc accounts, I would greatly appreciate it!

For those interested this is my solution to the project from Codecademy PRO's "Full Stack Engineer Pro Path".

I am always interested in learning from experienced programmers how I can improve my code so please feel free to hit me up with suggestions!
